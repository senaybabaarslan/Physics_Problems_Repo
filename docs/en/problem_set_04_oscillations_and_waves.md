## Problem 10 – Double pendulum and deterministic chaos

Objective: **purely numerical analysis** of a double pendulum and visualization of deterministic chaos.

Consider a double pendulum (two massive points $m_1, m_2$ on massless rods $l_1, l_2$) in a uniform gravitational field $g$. Assume the equations of motion from the standard form for a double pendulum (we do not derive them analytically in this problem set).

1. Write the coordinates $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ as functions of the angles $(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ (for animation).
2. Implement a numerical integration of the equations (e.g., RK4) and check numerical stability (e.g., energy drift for different $\Delta t$).
3. Investigate the sensitivity to initial conditions: **simulate simultaneously 50 copies** of the system with minimally different initial conditions (e.g., a perturbation only in $\theta_2(0)$ on the order of $10^{-4}$–$10^{-2}$ rad).
4. Experiment with different scales of perturbation and observe the divergence of the trajectories.

Starting parameters (to standardize results): $m_1=m_2=1$, $l_1=l_2=1$, $g=9.81$, integration step $\Delta t\le 0.01$ s.

HTML requirement: animation of the double pendulum in "ensemble" mode — **50 pendulums simultaneously**, each in a **different color**, to show the divergence; add a reset and the ability to set the perturbation scale.
